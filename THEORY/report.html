Global Mean Surface Temperature to 2 Degrees Centigrade by 2100: An
Investigation Using the C-ROADS World Climate Model </FONT>

<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">In this
investigation, the C-ROADS World Climate model was used to examine a
scenario in which global mean surface temperature (GMST) is limited
to less than or equal to 2 degrees centigrade by 2100. The scenario
was based on the assumption that significant policy action is taken
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit climate change.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">The results of
the simulation indicate that by 2100, CO2 concentrations in the
atmosphere will be 450 parts per million (ppm). This is a significant
reduction from current concentrations, which are around 414 ppm as of
2021. The reduction in CO2 concentrations is a result of a
combination of measures aimed at reducing emissions, including the
increased use of renewable energy, the implementation of carbon
pricing mechanisms, and improvements in energy efficiency.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">Another
important finding of the simulation is that sea-level rise is
projected to be 0.56 meters by 2100. This is a relatively low
increase compared to other projections and is a result of the reduced
emissions and corresponding decrease in global warming.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">Emissions per
capita, measured in tonnes of CO2 per year and per person, are
projected to be 0.03 by 2100. This represents a significant reduction
in emissions per capita compared to current levels, which are around
4.5 tonnes of CO2 per person per year.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">The scenario
and results presented in this investigation are based on the
assumption that significant policy action is taken to reduce
emissions and limit climate change. The results of the simulation
provide an estimate of the likely range of future greenhouse gas
emissions and temperature increases under this scenario. The findings
of this investigation demonstrate that it is possible to limit GMST
to less than or equal to 2 degrees centigrade by 2100 if significant
policy action is taken.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">It is important
to note that the C-ROADS model is a simplified representation of the
real world and the actual outcome may vary. Additionally, the
scenario presented in this investigation is based on a specific set
of assumptions, and other scenarios and assumptions may yield
different results. Nevertheless, this investigation provides valuable
insights into the potential benefits of taking significant policy
action to reduce emissions and limit climate change.</P>
<P STYLE="border: 1px solid #d9d9e3; padding: 0.05cm">In conclusion,
the results of this investigation using the C-ROADS World Climate
model show that it is possible to limit GMST to less than or equal to
2 degrees centigrade by 2100 if significant policy action is taken.
The model simulation suggests that by 2100 CO2 concentrations will be
450 ppm, sea-level rise will be 0.56 meters, and emissions per capita
will be 0.03 tonnes of CO2 per year and per person. These results are
important for informing policy decisions and guiding efforts to
mitigate climate change.</P>
