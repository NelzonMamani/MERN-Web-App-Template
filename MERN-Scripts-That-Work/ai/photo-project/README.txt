fileReaderFileProducer.js needs list.txt in order to generate the backend-web-project skeleton


list.txt needs to be a list of category names for any web app preferably single name each line

fileReaderFileProducer.js will use that list and eliminate skip the first line which is a title  
it produces models, routes and controllers
