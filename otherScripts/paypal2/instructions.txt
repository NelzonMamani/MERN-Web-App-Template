1. donation.html - This file contains the form that users will fill out to make a donation. It includes fields for the user's name, email, and donation amount, as well as a button to submit the form.
2. donation.js - This file contains the JavaScript logic for handling the form submission and making the payment through PayPal. It includes a function for validating the form data, a function for initializing the PayPal checkout, and a function for handling the response from PayPal.
3. paypal.js - This file contains the code for integrating with the PayPal API. It includes functions for creating a payment, executing a payment, and handling any errors that may occur during the process.
4. success.html - This file is displayed to the user after a successful donation. It thanks the user for their donation and provides information about how their donation will be used.
5. error.html - This file is displayed to the user if there is an error during the donation process. It informs the user that their donation was not successful and provides instructions for how they can try again.
6. validation.js - This file contains the code for validating the form data before submitting it to PayPal. It includes functions for checking that all required fields are filled out and that the donation amount is a valid number.
7. config.js - This file contains configuration settings for the PayPal API and other global variables used in the donation process.
8. index.js - This file is the entry point of the application and it is responsible for handling routing and setting up the server.
