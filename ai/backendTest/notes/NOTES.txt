validation-related functions in a validation.js file: 

 validateUserData() function would be responsible for checking that the data provided by the client when creating a new user is valid, such as the email address is in the correct format and the password meets certain security criteria.

 validatePost() function would be responsible for checking that the data provided by the client when creating a new post is valid, such as the post's title and body are not empty and are within acceptable bounds.

 validateComment() function would be responsible for checking that the data provided by the client when creating a new comment is valid, such as the comment's body is not empty and is within acceptable bounds.

 verifyToken() function would be responsible for checking that the token provided by the client is valid and has not expired.


authentication and authorization-related functions in an auth.js file:

authenticateUser() function would be responsible for verifying the user's credentials, such as their username and password, and determining if the user is who they claim to be. Once a user is authenticated, a token is issued to them.

authorizeUser() function would be responsible for checking if an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a particular endpoint or perform a specific action. It verifies if the user has the necessary roles or permissions to access the endpoint or perform the action.
