# THIS IS MY PLAYGROUND

### My lab and work enviroment where I experiment with pieces of code

1. FIRST STAGE: I experiment with codes here:
- MERN-Scripts-That-Work/**backend** for backend APIs and server side scripts  
- MERN-Scripts-That-Work/**frontend** for frontend REACT user interface  



2. SECOND STAGE: All the codes that worked for me is ***saved*** in **MERN-Scripts-That-Work** 
- In **MERN-Scripts-That-Work/*backend*** are all codes that are backend related
- in  **MERN-Scripts-That-Work/*frontend*** are all the pieces of REACT code that worked for me

> The rest of the folders are just for me to remember where I am and what to do next
